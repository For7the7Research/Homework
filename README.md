## I am a biologist with a background focused in microbiology and data science.

1. Become comfortable using python coding language
2. Become adept at handling large data repositories using python and sql
3. Become skilled in developing visually pleasing and understandable graphical representations of data with Tableau
4. Learn about the data heavy potential of Excel
5. Enter the field of Biological Sciences as a trained Data Analyst

Here is a python article that I found useful and interesting. It shows that NOAA data is accessible using Python: [NOAA data and Python](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/global/examples/usingpython.shtml)

The image above is of a prairie in Missouri. Missouri is home to many different habitats that are essential to maintaining a stable, healthy environment that is beneficial to us and the other creatures that live within these environments. Maintiaining them ensures the survival of the planet. Missouri has a habitat called a peat bog, which stores more carbon than forests. Removing just one can lead to climate warming sooner that it was meant to occur, which causes mass mortalities. Looking at images of these natural environments inspires me because the work that Data Scientists perform help field and bench scientists plan their conservation efforts. Knowing my training here could one day preserve an essential habitat locally makes me extremely happy.
